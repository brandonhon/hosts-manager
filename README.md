#### Configuration File

The configuration file is automatically created at:
- **Linux/macOS**: `~/.config/hosts-manager/config.yaml`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\hosts-manager\config.yaml`

Example configuration:

```yaml
general:
  default_category: custom
  auto_backup: true
  dry_run: false
  verbose: false
  editor: nano

categories:
  development: "Development environments and local services"
  staging: "Staging and testing environments"
  production: "Production services and critical infrastructure"
  custom: "User-defined entries"

profiles:
  minimal:
    description: "Minimal profile with essential entries only"
    categories: ["production"]
    default: false
  development:
    description: "Development profile"
    categories: ["development", "staging"]
    default: false
  full:
    description: "Full profile with all categories"
    categories: ["development", "staging", "production", "custom"]
    default: true

ui:
  color_scheme: auto
  show_line_numbers: true
  page_size: 20

backup:
  directory: ""  # Auto-detected
  max_backups: 10
  retention_days: 30
  compression_type: gzip
```

## File Structure

The hosts manager organizes entries using special comment markers:

```
# @category development Development services
# =============== DEVELOPMENT ===============
127.0.0.1 myapp.local # My application
192.168.1.100 api.dev web.dev # Development APIs

# @category production Production services
# =============== PRODUCTION ===============
10.0.0.100 api.production.com
```

## Security Features

Hosts Manager implements comprehensive security measures to protect your system:

### Input Validation & Sanitization
- **Comprehensive IP validation** - Validates IPv4/IPv6 addresses with security checks for dangerous ranges
- **RFC-compliant hostname validation** - Prevents malicious hostnames and injection attacks
- **Path traversal protection** - Sanitizes file paths to prevent unauthorized file access
- **Anti-injection measures** - Protects against script injection, command injection, and null byte attacks
- **Homograph attack detection** - Prevents IDN spoofing and similar-looking character attacks

### Secure File Operations
- **Atomic file operations** - Prevents corruption during concurrent access
- **Exclusive file locking** - Uses system-level locks to prevent race conditions
- **Stale lock detection** - Automatically cleans up abandoned lock files
- **Secure temporary files** - Creates temporary files with appropriate permissions

### Privilege Management
- **Minimal privilege escalation** - Only requests elevated privileges when necessary
- **Platform-specific elevation** - Uses appropriate methods for each operating system
- **Strict security mode** - Enhanced privilege checking for security-sensitive operations
- **Permission validation** - Verifies write permissions before attempting modifications

### Audit & Monitoring
- **Comprehensive audit logging** - Tracks all security-relevant operations
- **Security violation detection** - Logs and alerts on suspicious activities
- **Automatic log rotation** - Prevents audit logs from consuming excessive disk space
- **Tamper-evident logs** - Uses structured JSON format with timestamps and integrity checking

### Configuration Security
- **Schema validation** - Validates all configuration values against security policies
- **Editor whitelist** - Only allows execution of approved, safe text editors
- **Template sanitization** - Prevents dangerous template constructs and operations
- **Safe error handling** - Sanitizes error messages to prevent information disclosure

### Backup Security
- **Secure deletion** - Overwrites file content before deletion
- **Integrity verification** - Uses SHA-256 hashing to verify backup integrity
- **Compressed backups** - Automatically compresses backups to save space
- **Retention policies** - Automatic cleanup of old backups based on age and count

### Additional Protections
- **Lock file prevents concurrent modifications** - System-level file locking
- **Dry-run mode for safe testing** - Preview changes without applying them
- **Always creates backups before modifications** - Automatic safety net
- **Permission elevation only when needed** - Follows principle of least privilege
- **IPv6 link-local address warnings** - Logs warnings for potentially problematic addresses
- **Null byte injection protection** - Prevents null byte attacks in all inputs

### Security Best Practices
- All sensitive files created with restrictive permissions (0600/0700)
- Comprehensive input validation on all user-provided data
- Error messages sanitized to prevent information disclosure
- Audit trail for all security-relevant operations
- Regular validation of system state and permissions

### Security Audit Trail
This project has undergone comprehensive security auditing:
- **Initial Security Rating**: B+ (Good)
- **Post-Hardening Rating**: A- (Excellent)
- **Critical Issues**: 1 resolved (path validation gap)
- **Medium Issues**: 3 resolved (command injection, IPv6 policy, error disclosure)
- **Low Priority Issues**: 4 resolved (race conditions, log management, config validation, DoS prevention)

Key security improvements implemented:
- Zero tolerance for path traversal attacks
- Complete audit log injection prevention
- Resource exhaustion protection in all file operations
- Comprehensive input sanitization across all attack vectors
- Enterprise-grade temporal and process isolation

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Denied
**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
sudo hosts-manager add 127.0.0.1 myapp.local
```

**Windows:**
Run PowerShell or Command Prompt as Administrator.

### Backup Directory
The backup directory is automatically created. Default locations:
- **Linux**: `~/.local/share/hosts-manager/backups`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/hosts-manager/backups`
- **Windows**: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hosts-manager\backups`

### Configuration Issues
Reset to default configuration:
```bash
rm ~/.config/hosts-manager/config.yaml  # Linux/macOS
hosts-manager config --show             # Will recreate default config
```
